Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Text Generation

Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a text generation model using advanced NLP techniques. The model generates coherent and fluent text sequences by training on a corpus of text data. We use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer architectures to achieve this goal.

Objectives:
Develop a text generation model using RNNs or Transformer architectures.
Train the model on a substantial text corpus.
Generate novel text samples.
Provide a qualitative evaluation of text coherence and fluency.

Requirements:
Python Code: The implementation of the text generation model.
Trained Model Checkpoints: Saved states of the trained model for future use.
Generated Text Samples: Examples of the text produced by the model.
Qualitative Evaluation: Analysis of the text coherence and fluency.

Model Architecture

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are a class of neural networks suitable for sequence data. They maintain a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps, allowing them to generate text sequences.

Transformer Architectures: Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence, enabling them to capture long-range dependencies more effectively than RNNs.

Dataset: The model is trained on a large text corpus to learn the language patterns. 
Commonly used datasets for such tasks include:
Project Gutenberg: A collection of classic literature texts.
Wikipedia Dumps: Comprehensive and diverse text data.
OpenSubtitles: Dialogues from movies and TV shows.

Implementation:
1. Data Preprocessing
Tokenization: Breaking text into words or subwords.
Normalization: Converting text to a consistent format.
Sequencing: Creating sequences of tokens for model training.
2. Model Training
Model Configuration: Setting up the architecture and parameters.
Training Loop: Iteratively feeding data to the model and updating weights.
Checkpointing: Saving the model state at intervals.
3. Text Generation
Seed Text: Providing an initial text sequence.
Generation Loop: Using the model to predict the next token and appending it to the sequence.
Results
